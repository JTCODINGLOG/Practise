sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: After performing trials on random lists I already decided that sort 2 was out of the question because it is merge sort.
I also had an idea of which could be the others because usually bubble sort performs slower than selection sort in random lists.
Then I just needed to try sort 1 and 3 with sorted lists, because the difference relay in their omega.
Sort 1 (omega n) is Bubble sort because it performs in these lists faster than sort 3 (omega n squared), which is by elimination selection sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: I just needed to use it on the random lists provided. It performed way faster than sort 1 and 3.

sort3 uses: Selection sort
